#TypeHuman
##The operating system for the modern organisation
TypeHuman is an open source organisation operating system with a focus on self-management principles.

The methodology in developing this project is to collaborate around principles, conventions, and policies that inform a self-managing company operating model. This information is then taken and used to develop softwares and features that can be used to automate and support the TypeHuman organisation.

##Outline of the first release (v0.1)
There's much to do. The modern organisational operating system lends itself best to a software approach to it's development and ongoing maintenance. Buy that we mean that constant review and change is imperative, as opposed to the static lens by which most organisations view their structure and approach to date. To that end, our first release target of v0.1 should be MVP and establish the 'core features' of a self-managing organisation.

Outline of the to-do list:
+ Express guiding principles and values of a self-organising operating system
+ Agree on the approach for submitting issues, feature requests, and improvements against the TypeHuman framework
+ Identify organisational areas of concern for which conventions and policies can inform how a self-managing organisation responds, examples include:
  + Decision making
  + Conflict resolution
  + Role identification
  + Human resources
  + Salary and remunerating
+ Prioritise and deliver first set of policies for the self-managing organisation
