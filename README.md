TypeHuman
==================
The operating system for the modern organisation
==================
TypeHuman is an open source organisation operating system with a focus on self-management principles.

The methodology in developing this project is to collaborate around principles, conventions, and policies that inform a self-organising organisation first. This information is then taken and used to develop softwares and features that can be used to automate and support the TypeHuman organisation.
